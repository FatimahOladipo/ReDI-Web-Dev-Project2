# Nigerian Fashion

This is a very simple beginner web app to explore Nigerian traditional clothing attire and styles like Aso Oke, Isi Agu, Babariga.  
The project is currently in the early stages with basic structure (HTML, CSS, JS files created).  
More changes and features will be added as time goes on.
