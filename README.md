# Nigerian Fashion

This is a very simple beginner web app to explore Nigerian traditional clothing attire and styles like Aso Oke, Isi Agu, Babariga.  
The project is currently in the early stages with basic structure (HTML, CSS, JS files created).  
More changes and features will be added as time goes on.

JAVASCRIPT
I added a button called "See more" that shows more clothes when you click it!
How it works:
The showMore function tells the page to show 2 more clothing items each time you click.
The displayAttires function updates the page to show the new number of items.
